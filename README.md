# Sales-Forecasting-Time-Series
The Sales Forecasting project employs a systematic approach to analyze and predict sales data using diverse time series forecasting techniques in the R programming language. Beginning with the identification of time series components, the project utilizes the `ts()` function to create a comprehensive time series dataset and employs visualizations, such as data plots and autocorrelation charts, to discern patterns within the historical sales data. Subsequently, the analysis progresses to forecasting methodologies, including trailing moving averages (MA) and a two-level forecast integrating regression and trailing MA for residuals. The comparison of these forecasts using accuracy measures, such as MAPE and RMSE, allows for the identification of the most effective forecasting model for both validation periods and future 12-month projections.

Furthermore, the project delves into advanced exponential smoothing methods, specifically the application of the Holt Winter's (HW) model. By automating the selection of error, trend, and seasonality options, coupled with the determination of optimal smoothing parameters, the project demonstrates a sophisticated approach to time series forecasting. The accuracy of the HW model is evaluated against a seasonal na√Øve forecast, providing a comprehensive comparison of forecasting models. The conclusion synthesizes the findings, emphasizing the superiority of the identified forecasting model based on its performance metrics, thereby providing valuable insights for informed decision-making in sales planning and management.
